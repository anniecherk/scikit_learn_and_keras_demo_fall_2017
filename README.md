# scikit_learn_and_keras_demo_fall_2017
An ipython notebook to demonstrate scikit learn &amp; keras; for Machine Learning Fall 2017

## Step 1: Make sure you have python3 installed
Python2's end of life is in 2020. Python3 is really similar, but it will be maintained in the future.

## Step 2: Grab this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/anniecherk/scikit_learn_and_keras_demo_fall_2017
cd scikit_learn_and_keras_demo_fall_2017
```

## Step 3: Install some pre-requisite libraries
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Note: this setup installs the "CPU version" of tensorflow; if you're running some largely model you'll want to use the "GPU version" for much better efficiency. It's a slightly different setup that is outside the scope of this demo, but just something to keep in mind.

## Step 4: Run the ipython notebook
`jupyter notebook`
