    "\n",
    "## What are neural networks & deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about them in class soon! One good source of explanation is: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen Perceptron in class\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"perceptron.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When we used Perceptron in class, we classified based on whether the dot product of the example and the weights was *less than 0*. In neural networks this function- which decides whether or not an example is positive based on this dot product- is called an *activation function*. Many neural networks can learn non-linear functions because they use other activation functions such as \"relu\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is made by chaining a few Perceptron \"neurons\" togther:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nn.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "What you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A neural network is a non-linear classifier, like a decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "* In practice, they seem to work very well for certain kinds of data including images and text\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks are organized into \"layers\". Lots of choices of how exactly you set up these layer; a \"deep neural network\" is a neural network with many layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A perceptron is a very simple neural network (a single-layer neural network neural network)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Keras & what is it used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a library for deep learning, designed to make common types of neural networks very easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a layer on top of a more powerful, but more difficult to use, library called TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to use \"standard\" neural nets, Keras is better; if you want to use very fancy or complicated models you should use Tensorflow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Tons of examples:\n",
    "https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a model in Keras by specifying which model you want to use, and how you want to train it; Keras takes care of the rest. Keras has many options of \"standard\" models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, at test time, each perceptron \"votes\" and we choose the label based on the \"most confident\" vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "ie, at test time we have an example that is truely a \"1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "the \"0 or not 0\" classifier returns a negative value (meaning \"it's not a 0!\")\n",
